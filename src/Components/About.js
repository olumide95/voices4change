          The death of Mr George Floyd, a black American man, on an obscure
          Minneapolis street corner, under the knee of a white police officer
          triggered the most spontaneous and contagious protests the United
          States have witnessed in decades. As the coronavirus pandemic rage,
          the world watches as large swaths of people across the country
          sacrificed social distancing at the alter of a cry in unison for
          social justice. Reverberating energy, resounding consciousness and
          explicit sense of conviction seemed to have fueled these protests,
          keeping them going and growing in the US for eighteen days now.
          Notably, the protests have spread to over 60 countries representing
          every continent, except Antarctica. George Floyd assumed fame, and
          some say martyrdom in death. Without question, the death of this man
          has sparked off a global civil right movement which we believe inspire
          the preservation of the message, sentiments, motives, drive, energy,
          purpose and clarion cries for social reform that defines this moment.
          The energy inherent in this movement must not be frittered but rather
          harvested to drive real change. We established this site to capture
          and memorialize the sentiments of the millions of protesters as
          projected in their numerous written messaging on posters, placards,
          items of clothing and general merchandise on display at various
          rallies across the globe over the past couple of weeks.
          <br />
          We invite every citizen, leader and corporate whose conviction of an
          endemically broken social contract in society, motivated them to
          participate in any of the protests, to opt-in to this community of
          consciousness. We implore you to please take a moment and publish your
          unique message on this platform. This site offers you the opportunity
          to transfer your words and thoughts from the signs you created or seen
          at protests and rallies by filling out a simple form. We intend this
          site to be that platform where your contributions will enable the
          realization of a positive social multiplier effect, where the fusion
          of individual convictions and yearnings is synthesized with the
          abundance and forward transfer of positive energy and then unleashed
          for a common purpose - the achievement of a more just society. If you
          havenâ€™t attended a rally in your city you can still contribute by
          typing your thoughts and comments about the current issues of the day
          such as the serial police brutality and unjust killings in the
          American society - Speak up; your voice will be amplified to affect
          change!
